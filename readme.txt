node.js & mongoDB tutorial


NoSQL databases came back into the mainstream when developers needed better performance and were ok to give up the relational aspect of RDBs (unions, joins, etc). To use the NoSQL datastore mongoDB with your node instance, you need to install:
- mongoDB
- node-mongo driver
- mongoose (optional but strongly encouraged)

The mongoDB schema is dynamic, meaning it gets defined every single time you launch your node server file.

Easy horizontal scaling.
